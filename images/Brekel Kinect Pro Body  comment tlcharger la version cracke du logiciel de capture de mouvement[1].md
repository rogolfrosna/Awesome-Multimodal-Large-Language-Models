## Installation
 
To install Brekel Kinect Pro Body, you will need the following system requirements:
 
- Windows 8 / 8.1 / 10 (USB stack of Windows 7 or below canât handle bandwidth requirements of v2 sensor and is NOT supported)
- USB 3.0 port, Intel and Renesas chipsets only! (others brands may or may not work)
- DirectX 11 capable GPU (Intel HD4000, AMD Radeon HD6470M / HD6570, NVIDIA Geforce 610M or above)
- 4 GB or more RAM
- Dual Core 3.1Ghz i7/i5 CPU (slower should work but may drop frames)
- 1280Ã1024 screen (recommended: 1920Ã1080 or higher)

You will also need a Kinect for Windows v2 or Kinect for Xbox One sensor and the Microsoft Kinect SDK drivers[^1^]. The Brekel Kinect Pro Body installer will automatically download and install these for you.
 
To download the installer, go to [https://brekel.com/body\_v2/](https://brekel.com/body_v2/) and click on the "Download Trial / Buy" button. You can choose between a free trial version that records up to 10 seconds, or a full retail version that costs $199. The installer will guide you through the installation process and ask you to enter your license key if you have one.
 
## Usage
 
Once you have installed the software, you can launch it from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see a main window with a 3D viewport that shows the live feed from your Kinect sensor. You can switch between different views such as color, infrared, depth, pointcloud, skeleton and hand states by clicking on the buttons at the top.
 
To start recording, you need to select which output formats you want to use. You can choose between FBX, BVH, TXT, CSV and BKF formats. Each format has its own settings that you can adjust by clicking on the "Settings" button next to it. For example, you can choose which FBX file format version to use, whether to export positions and rotations or only rotations, whether to resample the data to a different frame rate, etc.
 
You can also enable audio recording by selecting an audio device from the drop-down menu at the bottom left. You can choose to record from the Kinect's microphone or any other audio source connected to your computer. You can also print the filename and/or framenumber to the AVI movie if you want.
