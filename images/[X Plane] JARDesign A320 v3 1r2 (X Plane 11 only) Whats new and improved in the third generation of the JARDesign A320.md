## Exterior and Interior Modeling
 
The JARDesign A320 v3 1r2 features a high-quality exterior model, with accurate dimensions, shapes and details. The textures are crisp and realistic, with various effects such as reflections, dirt, wear and tear. The model also includes animated parts such as landing gear, flaps, spoilers, ailerons, elevators, rudder, thrust reversers, doors and windows.
 
The interior model is equally impressive, with a detailed cockpit and cabin. The cockpit features a fully functional 3D panel, with working switches, knobs, buttons and displays. The instruments are clear and readable, with smooth animations and transitions. The cockpit also has realistic lighting effects, such as backlighting, floodlights and dome lights.
 
The cabin features a complete passenger section, with seats, overhead bins, windows and doors. The cabin also has dynamic lighting effects, such as reading lights and emergency lights. The cabin can be customized with different seat configurations and liveries.
 
## Sound and Effects
 
The JARDesign A320 v3 1r2 has a superb sound package, with realistic engine sounds, cockpit sounds and environmental sounds. The engine sounds are based on real recordings of the CFM56-5B engines that power the A320 family. The sounds vary depending on the engine power setting, speed and altitude. The cockpit sounds include various alerts, warnings, clicks, beeps and voices. The environmental sounds include wind noise, rain noise, ground noise and more.
 
The JARDesign A320 v3 1r2 also has several effects that enhance the immersion and realism of the simulation. These include wing flexing effects that simulate the bending of the wings under load; contrail effects that create vapor trails behind the engines; smoke effects that create smoke when landing or braking; fire effects that create fire when an engine fails; ice effects that create ice on the wings when flying in cold conditions; rain effects that create rain drops on the windows when flying in wet conditions; brake temperature effects that show the temperature of the brakes on the ECAM display; tire skid marks effects that create skid marks on the runway when landing or braking hard; ground handling effects that simulate the movement of ground vehicles around the aircraft; copilot plugin effects that add a virtual copilot who can assist you with various tasks.
